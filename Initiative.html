    <ul>
      <li>Due to a weak economy or infrastructure, millions of people worldwide suffer due to a lack of access to safely managed drinking water services</li>
      <li>Fortunately, great progress has been made to further the advancemnets of sanitation and clean water services, in that over 90% of the world has access to safely managed drinking water services</li>
      <li>To improve levels of sanitation and access to safely managed drinking water services, a larger amount of money must be invested into the mangement of freshwater ecosystems, as well as sanitation facilities in developing countries such as Ethiopia</li>
    </ul>
      <h2 id=p> SDG 6.1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>By 2030, the United Nations hopes to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all</li>
      <li>This would mean that 100% of the wolrd has access to sage and affordable drinking water services</li>
      <li>One possible solution to help acheive the goal would be to educate the citizens in developing countries about filtering methods to convert dirty water into water that can be drank</li>

    <h1 id=p> The African Water Crisis </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Developing Countries in Africa suffer a lack of access to drinking water services at a disproportionate rate because of their weak eonomy and infrastructure</li>
      <li>115 people in Africa die every hour from diseases linked to poor sanitation, poor hygiene and contaminated water</li>
      <li>By educating citizens in developing countries about the various methods of filtering water, they would be able to become more self-sustaining instead of relying on others for their own survival</li>
      <li>Another way to help people struggling with a lack of access to safely mangaed drinking water services would be to donate to organizations and charities who focus on this this problem</li>
